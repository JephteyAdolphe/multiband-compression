**Dependencies**:
   Required: Signal Processing Toolbox
   Optional: Parallel Computing Toolbox
 
**Running the Program**:
1. Extract the zipped files into a folder.
2. Navigate to the folder in MATLAB, and double click the project.mlapp file to open the app designer.
3. Press the "Run" button with the green play icon. This can be found under the designer tab on the top toolbar.
4. Input the FULL path to the audio file on your computer. Ensure that the audio is in a location that does not require administrator access to access, as the program does not have administrator permissions. Include the file extension in the path. The program was only tested with .wav files. Other file formats may work, however they are untested.
5. Adjust the parameters to your liking, and when the settings are configured press the green "compress" button.
	   
**Note**: The amount of time the program needs to apply the compression depends on the length of the input file and the speed of your computer. Short audio clips on modern computers should only take a few seconds to process. Longer clips will take longer.
